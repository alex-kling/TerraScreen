!  PURPOSE
!      CONVECT CHECKS FOR (SUPERADIABATIC) POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE
!      INSTABILITIES BETWEEN ADJACENT LAYERS FOR A GIVEN 'PI' GRID
!      POINT. ANY INSTABILITIES ARE RESOLVED BY THE PROCESS OF
!      ATMOSPHERIC CONVECTION. THE EXTENT AND THE POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE
!      OF THE CONVECTIVE ZONE ARE ALSO DETERMINED. (THE CONVECTIVE
!      ZONE STARTS AT THE SURFACE AND INCLUDES ALL LAYERS THAT EXCHANGE
!      HEAT WITH THE SURFACE THROUGH CONVECTION.)

!######################################################################

!     IN CONVECT, THE TEMPERATURE AT THE MIDPOINT OF A LAYER IS USED
!     AS AN APPROXIMATION FOR THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WHOLE LAYER.
!     FOR THE ATMOSPHERE TO BE STABLE AT A POINT, THE POTENTIAL
!     TEMPERATURE MUST BE NON-DECREASING AS A FUNCTION OF ALTITUDE
!     (NON-INCREASING AS A FUNCTION OF THE LEVEL INDEX K FOR EVEN K.)
!     IF THE ATMOSPHERE IS UNSTABLE, CONVECT ADJUSTS THE POTENTIAL
!     TEMPERATURE VALUES UNTIL THE ATMOSPHERE IS STABLE. WHEN CONVECT
!     FINDS A SET OF ADJACENT LAYERS THAT LACKS STABILITY, IT CHANGES
!     THE POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE FOR ALL LAYERS IN THE SET TO AN
!     ENERGY-WEIGHTED AVERAGE VALUE IN A WAY THAT CONSERVES THE TOTAL
!     HEAT ENERGY OF THE LAYERS IN THE SET. ANY ADJUSTMENTS MADE THAT
!     INVOLVE LEVELS 4 OR 6 (THE TOP TWO LAYERS OF THE TROPOSPHERE)
!     INCLUDE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE OF THE
!     STRATOSPHERE ( TETA(3) ) TO KEEP TETA(3) A LINEAR EXTRAPOLATION
!     IN LOG OF PRESSURE FROM TETA(4) AND TETA(6). AS SPECIFIED IN THE
!     NOTE OF 7-7-82, THERE ARE THREE TYPES OF ADJUSTMENTS (TYPES A, B,
!     AND C) WHICH ARE USED DEPENDING ON THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE
!     STRATOSPHERE.  THE ALGORITHM USED IN CONVECT RESEMBLES
!     MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION.  START WITH SET OF THE TOP TWO LAYERS
!     OF THE TROPOSPHERE.  MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE
!     STABLILITY FOR THE SET.  ADD NEXT LAYER OF THE TROPOSPHERE TO
!     THE SET.  MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE STABLILITY
!     FOR THE SET.  CONTINUE ADDING LAYERS AND STABLIZING RESULTANT
!     SET UNTIL THE SET  CONTAINS ALL OF THE TROPOSPHERE.
!
!     IF THE BOTTOM LAYER GETS ADJUSTED IN THIS PROCESS, THEN THERE
!     WILL BE A (VERTICAL) INTERVAL FROM THE SURFACE OF THE PLANET TO
!     WHAT IS CALLED 'THE TOP OF THE CONVECTIVE ZONE' OVER WHICH THE
!     POTENTIAL TEMPERATURES ARE CONSTANT. IN THIS CASE, THIS INTERVAL
!     IS THE CONVECTIVE ZONE. (SEE BELOW IN CODE FOR THE OTHER CASE.)
!     (IF TWO ADJACENT LAYERS HAVE THE SAME POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE, THE
!     ADJUSTMENT MADE IS ACADEMIC AND ONLY SERVES TO ADVANCE THE
!     ALGORITHM IN DETERMINING THE EXTENT OF THE CONVECTIVE ZONE. THUS
!     THE BORDERLINE STABLE CASE IS HANDLED AS UNSTABLE.)

!#=====================================================================

!     CALCULATE SOME FREQUENTLY USED EXPRESSIONS.

!     WTC is a weighting factor for convection.  WTC * TETA is
!     proportional to the heat energy of the layer.

      WTC(3) = OM(3) * YM(2)

      DO 100  K = 4, L_LEVELM1, 2
        WTC(K) = OM(K)*YM(K)
  100 CONTINUE

      BETACON = - PLOGADJ(3)/(PLOGADJ(4)+PLOGADJ(5))

!     EACH TIME THROUGH THE FOLLOWING LOOP ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO THE
!     SET AND THEN MAKES THE ATMOSPHERE STABLE FOR THAT SET.

!     IF LEVELS K AND K+2 ARE STABLE, THE WHOLE SET OF LAYERS IS
!     STABLE. THIS IS BECAUSE IF K = 4, THERE ARE NO OTHER LAYERS, AND
!     IF K > 4, THE PREVIOUS TIME THROUGH THIS LOOP LEFT TETA(K)
!     NON-DECREASING IN ALTITUDE FOR LEVELS 4 TO K.

      DO 1000 K=4,L_LEVELM3,2

!       If stable, no adjustments are needed so by-pass the next
!       section

        IF (TETA(K).GT.TETA(K+2))   GOTO 900

!       INSTABILITY FOUND.  MAKE ADJUSTMENTS REQUIRED TO MAKE
!       TETA(K) NON-DECREASING IN ALTITUDE FROM LEVEL K+2 TO THE
!       TROPOPAUSE.

!       Set up for the next loop.

!       LAYER EACH TIME THROUGH THIS LOOP. THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THIS
!       LOOP, KJ = K AND TECON = TETA(K+2); SO WE ARE ADJUSTING THE
!       INSTABILITY WE FOUND ABOVE. THUS THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THIS
!       LOOP WE  GOTO 500 . AFTER THIS TETA(K) AND TETA(K-2) MAY NO
!       LONGER BE STABLE, SO WE KEEP WORKING UNTIL WE REACH THE
!       TROPOPAUSE OR UNTIL WE PERFORM AN ADJUSTMENT THAT DOES NOT CAUSE
!       ANY NEW INSTABILITY.
!
!       SINCE EACH TIME THROUGH THIS LOOP WE INCLUDE ONE MORE LAYER, THE
!       LOOP MUST HANDLE TWO CASES, THE CASE OF NO MORE INSTABILITIES
!       FOUND, AND THE CASE OF NEW INSTABILITIES FOUND.
